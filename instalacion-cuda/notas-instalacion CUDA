Please make sure that
 -   PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-11.8/bin
 -   LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-11.8/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-11.8/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root

To uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run cuda-uninstaller in /usr/local/cuda-11.8/bin
To uninstall the NVIDIA Driver, run nvidia-uninstall
Logfile is /var/log/cuda-installer.log




To check if tensorflow is installed correctly:
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"


CUDA 11.8 installed because it failed when executing using tensorflow via pip
Do not install tensorboard_logger in the same python container, it will break future executions of main_supcon.py
