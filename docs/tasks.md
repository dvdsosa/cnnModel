# Tasks

## DONE
- [x] Preprocessing: create training and testing sets, 01RandomSplitDataset.py file.
- [x] Preprocessing: calculate mean and std for Z-Score formula, 02MeanStdVariables.py file.
- [x] Added Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) repository.
- [x] Added notification by email when it ends or breaks.
- [x] Added DYB-PlanktonNet dataset to main_supcon.py.
- [x] Added SeResNext50 model to SCL repository.
- [x] Learn how to do the inference with this method.
- [x] Calculate performance metrics Acc (top-1), Recall, Precision, F1-Score.
- [x] Peform training with original size of 224 by 224.
- [x] Train the backbone with DYB-linearHead dataset (train, val, test folders).
- [x] Train the backbone with DYB-cosine dataset (train, test folders).
- [x] Compare the performance of the backbone trained using SeResNext50 versus ResNet50. Reported on the paper draft.
- [x] Draw the plankton class distribution.
